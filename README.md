# The Cortex Project.
A server built using rust to breathe some new life into older systems.

### Why?
To anyone who's ever had a decade old computer they just can't get rid of, this is your solution. Weither it's because you have memories with it, or you're just too lazy this project aims to breathe some new life into that hardware!

### Ok, but why Rust?
I personally think Rust is the new C. With memory managment and a compiler that refuses to let you write unsafe code, it's relatively easy to write highly optimized programs. Which is exactly what's these older systems need.

### Why does it suck so much, and when will it get better?
Soonâ„¢.
I'm just a student, and i can't work on this full time. But the hope is that someone sees this and i can save at least one computer from getting tossed out. The less E-waste, the better.

### How can i help?
I'll admit, I'm not great at working with others. But if you make a pull request, i'll *try* to look at it. No promises. You can also reach out to me for just about any reason here!
